# Adding a New Tutorial

The base file for every tutorial is a regular Julia script which is converted into a Jupyter Notebook using Weave.jl for ease of access.
This approach makes it easier to compare diffs and track files in Git compared to entire Jupyter notebooks. 
It also allows us to set up CI testing for the tutorials to ensure that they produce the expected output 
and donâ€™t suffer from bit rot over time.




Lines starting with `#'` are used to denote markdown blocks 
For consistency, we use always use `#'`
